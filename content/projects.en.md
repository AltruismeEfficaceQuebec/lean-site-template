# Projects

If you have a project, or are interested in starting a project, we would be happy to help you. We can give you feedback, give you ideas, help you analyze your project idea in a framework of effective altruism, help you find funding, connect you with other people interested in these ideas, etc. It’s also possible to join an existing project, as well as volunteer or do an internship with Effective Altruism Québec. Contact us with any inquiry.

### Effective Altruism Montréal
Effective Altruism Montréal is a group supporting the community in Montréal. If you are interested in organizing events - presentation, reading group, social activity, etc. - write email us. It is also always a pleasure to meet you 1 on 1 to answer your questions about effective altruism. Join the discussion on our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AltruismeEfficaceMontreal/) or our [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/AltruismeEfficaceMontreal/).

### Recommendation for a $1M dollar donation
Two anonymous donors plan to donate 1 million Canadian dollars starting around 2020. They are looking for volunteers to suggest an effective non-profit organization. They are interested in finding an organization that reduces human misery as much as possible, with a focus on potentially transformative interventions: empowering people to improve their lives in a sustainable way.

### Course on rationality
We know an International Baccalaureate teacher interested in presenting content about human rationality in one of zir classes. We are looking for volunteers who can help, for example, by suggesting, creating and / or structuring content for the course.

### Reading group on AI safety
There has already been a reading group on AI safety at Mila and McGill, but these groups are currently inactive. However, there are still many people interested in joining such a group. Whatever your level of expertise and your main area of interest is, we would like to know if you’d be interested in participating to such a group. We have a Google group called [Montreal AI Safety](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/montreal-ai-safety) for people interested in reading on the Intelligent Agent Foundations.

### AI Safety Unconference
The AI Safety Unconference brings together people interested in AI safety for an afternoon of participant-driven moderated discussions. The focus of the event being to maximize valuable social time, supported by a minimal structure. Discussion groups will self-assemble to cover multiple topics and intersections of the field — from specific technical AI safety problems to longer-term governance issues. Check out [their website](https://aisafetyunconference.info/).

### Effective Altruism in French
Most of the content on effective altruism is in English. However, there are some efforts to help localize effective altruism in French. We are looking for people interested in contributing to the [glossary of concepts related to rationality and effective altruism](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/146P96UUueDbDU98rCTZPwtbBeGbodaqOWKUMUxX-zo4/), the [aggregation and curation of recommended resources on effective altruism and rationality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d35agyKOcKMZFbG8pDAA0F-pvngZBL54F232rdMk0wY/edit#gid=0), or the [effort of translating content on the effective altruism](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rr486cyBRaKcT9q3Kp81VPymTYPblBWkNaY2EM43n4U/).

### Student Group for Effective Altruists at Université de Montréal
The group has a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/aeudem/) and a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AltruismeEfficaceUdeM/), and has had a few meetings, but has never actually taken off. If you’re interested in getting involved, we can support you and put you in touch with other interested people.

### Group for Effective Altruists in Québec City
The group has a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AltruismeEfficaceVilledeQuebec/) and a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AltruismeEfficaceVilledeQuebec/). There was a big event in August 2017, but otherwise the group remained inactive. If you’re interested in getting involved, we can support you and put you in touch with other interested people.

### Group for Effective Altruists in your City or University
In general, we believe that education on issues of effective altruism can have a large positive impact. We would be interested in helping you to make an event (or other project) at your university or city. We have been to Sherbrooke and Québec City in 2017, but would return with pleasure.
